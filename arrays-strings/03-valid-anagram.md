## Problem: Valid Anagram (Easy)

**Link:** https://leetcode.com/problems/valid-anagram/

### Approach

I used a frequency array of 26 characters.
I increased the count for each character in the first string and decreased it for each character in the second string.
If all counts become zero, the strings are anagrams.

### Complexity

- Time: O(n)
- Space: O(1)

### Notes

Tested with both an anagram case and a non-anagram edge case.
